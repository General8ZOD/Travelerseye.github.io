                        We are juniors and seniors students at Prairie View A&M University who are majoring in 
                        Computer Science or Mathematics.  As a team, we collaborated about creating this website, 
                        agreeing on the page layout, color scheme, and what font to use to give insight on one 
                        country to visit from each continent.
