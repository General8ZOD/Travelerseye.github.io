                        <p>
                            Some cultural facts that are very important in Egypt are their strong family values and 
                            their religion. Most of the citizens in Egypt are Sunni Muslims and the rest are Jewish or 
                            Christians. They are very focused on being helpful and polite people because that is what 
                            they practice in witin their religion. They fast a lot during the month of Ramadan and 
                            are only allowed to work for six hours each day. The women in this country are expected to 
                            be conservative and modest as well. Also, film, jouralism, music, and art are significant 
                            in their day to day culture. </p>

                    <dd>Egypt’s public health system was straining badly.For almost every nation on earth, — including the richest —not only has the coronavirus proved an extraordinary, often humbling challenge, it has brought a political reckoning for their leaders. It lifted the fortunes of some, while endangering the futures of others.In return for limiting political freedoms, Mr. el-Sisi pledged security, prosperity and vastly improved public services. Reforming the health care system was “at the heart” of his plans.Budgets would soar and new hospitals would be built. Underpaid Egyptian doctors, who had been emigrating to oil-rich Persian Gulf countries in droves, would get a pay rise.</dd>
